      "description": "As an undergraduate research intern in the McNair Program, I had the opportunity to conduct extensive research and work on a challenging project: developing a coding translator. I built a parser, lexer, and semantic analyzer module to translate my custom code into assembly language for a virtual machine. \n\nCollaborating closely with my mentors, I gained invaluable guidance, refining my development skills and deepening my understanding of language design principles, including compiler design methodologies. This experience has equipped me with practical knowledge and hands-on experience in building parsers, lexers, and semantic analyzer/code generator modules while also enhancing my proficieny in fast-paced environments and ensuring that I can deliver project deliverables on time with efficiency and accuracy."
